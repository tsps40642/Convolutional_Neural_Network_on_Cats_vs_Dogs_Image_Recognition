# Convolutional_Neural_Network_on_Cats_vs_Dogs_Image_Recognition

## Overview
The main task is to build the best predictive model for distinguishing between cats and dogs images. 
I utilize Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to build a regression model to calculate the probability for that image to be a dog image.  

## Dataset
The train dataset contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats.  
Each image in this folder has the label as part of the filename (that is, having "cat" or "dog" in their file names).  

The test dataset contains 12,500 images, named according to a numeric id.  
For each image in the test set, I predict a probability that the image is a dog (1 = dog, 0 = cat).
